## Hi there 
I'm Sathwik M S
Aspiring Web Developer · Lifelong Learner
I'm currently learning web development and enjoy experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I love building websites, trying out new technologies, and sharing my progress.
Excited to keep growing and connect with other learners and developers!
